Welcome to the QScore Android App!  
  
QScore is a fun new way to encourage social distancing together with your friends.    
* Earn points for staying home  
* Add your friends to see their scores.    
* Customize your avatar with Giphy  
* Compare scores on leaderboards  
* Track your 24-hour progress  

## Setup
Before you can run the app, you will need to set up a couple of things:

- Add your Firebase `google-services.json` file for the application to the `app` directory
- Replace keys for Giphy and Facebook inside`app/src/main/res/values/secrets.xml`

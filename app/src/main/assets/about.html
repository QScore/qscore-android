<h3>About QScore </h3>

<p>QScore was built to encourage social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in a fun and unique way.</p>

<h4>Scoring</h4>

<p>Users can earn points by spending time within 150 meters of their home location. There are two scores: the all time score and the 24 hour
    score.<br/><br/>

    The all time score is determined by the total time spent at home and is continuously updated.<br/><br/>

    The 24-hour score is a rolling percentage of the time spent at home in the last 24 hours.<br/><br/>

    All time scores are public, and 24 hour scores are private.
</p>

<h4>Privacy</h4>

<p>QScore requires your home location to calculate your score. Your home location is private and will never leave your device.</p>


<h4>License</h4>
